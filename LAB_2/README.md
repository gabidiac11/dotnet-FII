### Parser (LAB_2/Utils/Parser/)

We also wrote tests for parser in `LAB_2/lab2.PartOne.Tests/`.

This module is only parsing data from file to a list of list of strings.

### Code design

   Part One: Weather Data and Part Two: Soccer League Table are 2 separate modules that implement common interfaces and abstract classes from `LAB_2/lab2.Core`. 
   
   PartOne and PartTwo:
   
      - defines the entity data to parse into
      - defines how a list of strings instantiate the entity (by  implmenting the IParser from lab2.Core)
      - the file to extract data from (by implementing the IProvider interface and by inheriting Provider abstract class from lab2.Core), 
      - what 2 properties to use for solving the kata problems
      - how to print the result on the screen the result
